# A Vim configuration
![Alt text](/../screenshots/images/Screenshot1.png?raw=true "Screenshot 1")

## Install
This will install a vimrc file into ~/.vim and run plugin installation
```
$ git clone git@github.com:markolly/vim-config.git ~/.vim
$ cd ~/.vim
$ make install
```

## Uninstall
This command will delete all contents of ~/.vim
```
$ make clean
```

### Notes
I would recommend iTerm2 instead of the standard terminal that comes with OSX. After extending VIM with various plugins the standard terminal becomes laggy and unresponsive.
