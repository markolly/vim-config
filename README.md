# A Vim configuration for OSX
![Alt text](/../screenshots/images/Screenshot1.png?raw=true "Screenshot 1")

## Pre-reqs
```
$ brew install ctags git
$ git clone git@github.com:markolly/vim-config.git ~/.vim
```

## Install
```
$ cd ~/.vim
$ make install
```

### Notes
I would recommend iTerm2 instead of the standard terminal that comes with OSX. After extending VIM with various plugins the standard terminal becomes laggy and unresponsive.
